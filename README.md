# d-bot

A simple discord.js bot used to create polls.<br>
Will maybe receive more functionality in the future, this is just a test.

You need to have node.js installed to run this bot <br>
To get the dependencies used by the bot cd into the directory where the files are located and run `npm install` <br>
Then to start the bot use `node .`
